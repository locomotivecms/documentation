  LocomotiveCMS runs as a rails engine: you need to create a Ruby On Rails app and include the LocomotiveCMS engine gem.

  You can install it locally or on your own server. If you want to host your site our [hosting solution](www.locomotivehosting.com), you don't need to follow theses instructions.

  # 1. Create a Ruby on Rails application

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
    Make sure you have installed <strong>Ruby on Rails 3.2.x</strong>, or checked the <a href="requirements">requirements</a>.
    </div>

      rails new myapp --skip-active-record --skip-test-unit --skip-javascript --skip-bundle
      cd myapp

  # 2. Include the LocomotiveCMS engine gem

    You have to tell your Ruby on Rails app that you want to include the LocomotiveCMS gem available on Gemcutter. Edit your application Gemfile and add these lines if missing.

      gem 'locomotive_cms', '~> 2.0.1', :require => 'locomotive/engine'
      gem 'unicorn', :group => 'development'
      gem 'compass-rails',  '~> 1.0.2', :group => 'assets'
      gem 'sass-rails',     '~> 3.2.4', :group => 'assets'
      gem 'coffee-rails',   '~> 3.2.2', :group => 'assets'
      gem 'uglifier',       '~> 1.2.4', :group => 'assets'

    If you run your engine on **Linux,** you also have to add the following gem

      gem 'therubyracer', '>= 0.8.2'

  # 3. Install the gems

      bundle install

  # 4. Add the editable engine config files

    The following command also inserts the engine routes to the main application

      bundle exec rails g locomotive:install

  # 5. Edit the engine settings

    Use your favorite IDE to edit the engine settings. Instructions are given as comments in setting files.

    First, configure your mongodb hostname and database name in `config/mongoid.yml`.

    Then configure the main settings: multisite activation, default locale, email sender (etc) in `config/initializers/locomotive.rb`.

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note</strong> By default, LocomotiveCMS uses Amazon S3 in production. To change it, modify the carrierwave initialization file.<br />
    <code>mate config/initializers/carrierwave.rb</code>
    </div>

  # 6. Run the application server

      bundle exec unicorn_rails

  # 7. Open your browser

      open http://localhost:8080/locomotive

    Follow the instructions in order to create your first administrator account and your first website.
