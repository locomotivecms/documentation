  # block

  Blocks are regions of content that you may want to override in children layouts.
  Their names are used to define the tabs in the backend and segment editable regions.

  <div class="alert alert-info">
  Nesting blocks is fine. However, their names must be unique.
  </div>

      {% raw %}{% block sidebar %}
      Sidebar goes here
      {% endblock %}

      {% block content %}
        Content goes here
      {% endblock %}
  {% endraw %}
  For more information about using the block tag, including nested blocks, check out the [basics of templating guide](/guides/templating/basics).
